Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to Urology after undergoing laparoscopic 
debulking left radical nephrectomy. No concerning intraoperative 
events occurred; please see dictated operative note for details. 
The patient received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The 
patient was transferred to the floor from the PACU in stable 
condition.  On POD0, pain was well controlled on epidural, 
hydrated for urine output >30cc/hour, provided with pneumoboots 
and incentive spirometry for prophylaxis. On POD1, the patient 
was restarted on home medications, basic metabolic panel and 
complete blood count were checked, pain control was transitioned 
to PCA, diet was advanced to a clearst. Pt was transfused 2u 
PRBC for Hct 23 and responded to Hct 28. On POD2, narcotics were 
changed to toradol since Cr was stable and pt did not tolerate 
narcotics well, urethral catheter (foley) was removed without 
difficulty, and diet was advanced to clears toast and crackers. 
POD# the JP was removed without incident. POD4 pt's Hct was 23 
again, Cr stable at 1.4 - CT scan w/o constrast failed to show 
active bleeding. The remainder of the hospital course was 
relatively unremarkable. The patient was discharged in stable 
condition, eating well, ambulating independently, voiding 
without difficulty, and with pain control on oral analgesics. On 
exam, incision was clean, dry, and intact, with no evidence of 
hematoma collection or infection. The patient was given explicit

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ underwent her ___ lower extremity full-thickness skin 
biopsy and 
VATS ___ lower lobe wedge resection, which she tolerated 
without complications. She was admitted to the floor after 
observation in the PACU with a Foley catheter to monitor urine 
output and a PCA for pain control. She had one ___ chest 
tube. She was put on a diet of sips to clears; home meds were 
restarted. CXR showed a moderate ___ pneumothorax with chest 
tube in place. On the floor, the patient complained of chest 
pain and a set of cardiac enzymes were sent to rule out 
myocardial infarction, which were negative. An EKG was obtained 
and no acute changes were observed. Her baseline dementia was 
felt to be an issue with regard to pain control; she would 
frequently forget to press the button and required several 
one-time doses of IV pain medication as a result.

On POD1, her Foley was discontinued and she was switch to oral 
pain medications. Another CXR showed no change. On POD2, the 
chest tube was removed. Her diet was advanced to regular but she 
developed nausea and vomiting, so her diet was dialed back and 
an NG tube was placed for temporary GI decompression. Several 
hours later, the NG tube was removed and her symptoms resolved. 
On POD3, another CXR showed no change. She tolerated regular 
diet, had good pain control on oral medications, and was voiding 
and passing gas and stool. She met discharge criteria and was 
discharged to home without further services. She was instructed 
to follow up in clinic with Dr. ___ on ___.

Micro:
___ 2:45 pm Blood Culture, Routine (Pending): 
___ 7:55 am Blood Culture, Routine (Pending): 

TTE ___:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal 
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but 
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no 
pericardial effusion.   

ECG ___:
Sinus rhythm. Consider left atrial abnormality. Consider left 
ventricular hypertrophy, although is non-diagnostic. Lateral 
lead ST-T wave abnormalities ___ be due to left ventricular 
hypertrophy or possible myocardial ischemia. Clinical 
correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of ___ 
no significant change. 

V/Q scan ___:
INTERPRETATION: 
Ventilation images obtained with Tc-99m aerosol in 8 views 
demonstrate no ventilation defects. 
  
Perfusion images in the same 8 views show a subsegmental defect 
in the left superoposterior lung, overlying the posterior 
segment of the left upper lobe, only seen in one view, and 
without corresponding defect on the ventilation scan and no 
pathololgy on CXR and therefore likely artifactual. 
  
Chest x-ray shows bibasilar atelectasis. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
Low likelihood of acute PE. 

Chest (PA & LAT) ___:
FINDINGS: There are decreased lung volumes bilaterally. There 
appears to be minimal bibasilar atelectasis. The left and right 
lung are otherwise clear. No pleural effusion. The hilar, 
mediastinal, and cardiac silhouette appear unremarkable.  
  
IMPRESSION: Minimal bibasilar atelectasis. No definite sign of 
pneumonia. 

RUQ ultrasound ___:
FINDINGS: There is an echogenic appearance of the liver 
consistent with fatty infiltration with regions of fatty sparing 
noted. Previously seen hypodensity is again demonstrated in the 
right lobe of the liver with posterior through transmission 
compatible with simple hepatic cyst. There is a shadowing 
gallstone within the GB and no US evidence to suggest acute 
cholecystitis.  Common bile duct is not dilated. Spleen is not 
enlarged. There is no right sided hydronephrosis. No ascites. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
1. Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration. Other 
forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including 
significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on 
this study. 
2. Simple hepatic cyst. 
3. Gallstone seen within otherwise normal gallbladder.  

CT chest w/o contrast ___:
FINDINGS: Punctate calcifications at the level of the left 
thyroid. No supraclavicular, infraclavicular, or axillary 
lymphadenopathy. No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. 
Mild-to-moderate coronary calcifications. No cardiac 
enlargement. No pericardial effusion, no pleural effusion. Fatty 
liver. Status post left nephrectomy . The right kidney is not 
visualized.  No evidence of adrenal lesions. No 
osteo-destructive lesions. 
  
Unchanged minimal apical scarring. 
  
Staple line in the left upper lobe, unchanged morphology. 
  
The part solid and part non-solid nodule in the left upper lobe 
(4, 80) is unchanged in size and morphology. The size of the 
solid component has not increased. Several other pulmonary 
nodules, for example in the left lower lobe (4, 139) are also 
all unchanged in size and morphology. The areas of scarring at 
the lingula are stable. At the bases of both lower lobes, areas 
of plate-like atelectasis have appeared in the dependent lung 
regions. These could represent areas of this atelectasis, but 
older pneumonia cannot be excluded. 
  
The airways are patent but subtle cylindrical bronchiectasis are 
seen in the mid lobe. 
  
IMPRESSION: Unchanged post-surgical appearance as compared to 
___, regarding the pre-existing pulmonary nodules 
in the site of resection in the left upper lobe. 
  
Newly appeared areas of plate-like atelectasis at the left and 
right lung bases. Presence of coexisting older pneumonia cannot 
be excluded. 
  
No newly appeared lung nodules. 
  
Status post left nephrectomy and adrenalectomy. 
  
Fatty infiltration of the liver. 
  
Despite their stability since ___, the nodule in the left 
upper lobe requires CT followup in six months, given the 
relatively high statistical probability for malignancy. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with stage IA lung adenocarcinoma s/p left 
lower lobe nodule wedge resection via VATS ___, renal 
oncocytoma s/p left radical nephrectomy ___, and primary 
hyperparathyroidism s/p left parathyroidectomy ___ 
presenting with chest pain.  
.  
#Chest pain: Pt reported one week of chest pain worse with deep 
inspiration and relieved with positional changes consistent with 
pleuritic chest pain. History and exam was otherwise 
unremarkable; she did not endorse fevers, cough, hemoptysis. 
Oxygen saturation was mid ___ on room air; she was not 
tachycardic or tachypneic. Blood pressure was equal in both 
arms, arguing against aortic dissection. Overlying skin did not 
show evidence of zoster.  EKG was unremarkable and cardiac 
enzymes negative x 3 sets.  CXR was unremarkable.  V/Q scan 
showed low likelihood of PE.  TTE showed EF >55%, no significant 
valvular disease, and no pericardial effusion. RUQ ultrasound 
showed echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration, 
simple hepatic cyst, and a gallstone in an otherwise normal 
gallbladder.  Lipase was initially elevated to 98 but 
downtrended to 85; pt did not have N/V to suggest pancreatitis.  
Pt did have history of lung adenocarcinoma with serial CT chest 
scans for monitoring; repeat noncontrast CT chest was performed 
which was largely stable. Pain was stable by time of discharge, 
likely musculoskeletal vs viral pleurisy given negative work-up. 
 She did not require any pain medications.  
.  
#Hypercalcemia: Pt with mildly elevated calcium level of 10.6 to 
10.9 despite recent parathyroidectomy. Albumin was normal. Total 
protein was wnl at 7.2.  She should continue to have her calcium 
levels followed by her PCP. 
.    
#Chronic kidney disease: Pt with baseline Cr 1.2 to 1.4. Cr 
remained within baseline range throughout hospital admission.  
Her lasix was held as pt appeared euvolemic and could not recall 
the reason she was taking this medication.  TTE showed EF > 55% 
and was otherwise unremarkable.  
.  
#Stage IA lung adenocarcinoma: Pt with stage IA lung 
adenocarcinoma s/p VATS ___. Last CT chest ___ showing 
unchanged appearance of mixed attentuation left upper lobe lung 
nodule (previously shown growth) and two year stability small 
solid nodules. Pt was scheduled for follow-up CT chest in 
___.  However, given her pleuritic chest pain, CT chest was 
obtained during this admission.  This revealed newly appeared 
areas of plate-like atelectasis, no new lung nodules, and stable 
nodule in left upper lobe.  She will need a follow-up CT in 6 
months. 
.  
#Renal oncocytoma: No acute issues.  Last CT abdomen ___ 
showed no evidence of local recurrence of renal oncocytoma. 
.  
#Short term memory loss: Pt with short term memory loss, at 
baseline per husband. She was A & O x 2 which pt reports is 
baseline (did not recall date). Per family, has had workup for 
Alzheimer's that has been negative.  She had an episode of 
confusion during her first night in the hospital, not recalling 
that she was in the hospital.  Confusion resolved after 
reorienting. 
.
#Non-gap Metabolic Acidosis:  Pt presented with bicarb level of 
17 without an anion gap.  This improved to 19 prior to discharge 
without any other electrolyte abnormalities.  She should have 
her electrolytes checked on her next PCP ___.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital.  You were 
admitted with chest pain.  Your EKG and blood tests did not show 
that you were having a heart attack.  Other imaging tests, 
including an echocardiogram of your heart, a chest x-ray, an 
abdominal ultrasound, and a lung perfusion study (to look for 
blood clots in the lungs) were all unremarkable. The abdominal 
ultrasound showed you have a gallstone but this did not look 
like it was causing infection. A noncontrast CT chest was 
largely stable from your previous scans.  

The following changes were made to your medications:
1) STOP lasix.  Please discuss whether you should be on this 
medication with your primary care doctor. 
2) STOP Klor-Con.  You doctor should check your lab work and 
will decide if you need to continue this medication
3) You are taking famotidine and omeprazole; these two 
medications have the same effect to prevent heartburn.  Please 
discuss with your primary care provider discontinuing one of 
them.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with multiple cancers including 
pancreatic and papillary renal now s/p C18 of gemcitabine last 
given ___ who presented to ED with hematemesis.

Her hematocrit fell from 21 to 18 though she was hemodynamically 
stable. In ED, NG lavage revealed clots. She had 2 20G PIVs and 
16G EJ placed. She was then transferred for EGD on ___. 
Her bleeding was initially thought to be secondary to a 
___ tear clinically. However, an EGD revealed a large 
fungating mass in her stomach and duodenum with an overlying 
clot, concerning for erosion. 

Throughout the EGD, she remained hemodynamically stable on 2L 
O2, mentating at her baseline with no further episodes of 
emesis.

She was placed on a PPI gtt and underwent a CTA abdomen which 
revealed an irregular gastroduodenal artery concerning for tumor 
involvement. She underwent ___ guided embolization of the 
gastroduodenal artery, was subsequently stabilized in the ICU

Pertinent Results:
CTA Abd/Pelv ___: IMPRESSION:
IMPRESSION:
 
1.No definite evidence of active bleeding.  The gastroduodenal 
artery
appears irregular in contour which can probably be explained by 
tumor
involvement.  A locally invasive pancreatic mass appears similar 
to perhaps
increased slightly but change in tumor burden is not shown 
conclusively and it is difficult to compare to the prior study 
because of differences in technique (prior study was performed 
without intravenous contrast).  Surrounding fat stranding 
appears stable and is likely secondary to post-radiation 
changes. 
2.Large new ulceration at the pylorus and proximal duodenum into 
the tumor, corresponding to the endoscopy finding.
3.Increased density within the lumen of the small and large 
bowel, in the
absence of recent oral contrast administration, is likely 
secondary to blood products. 

___ PROCEDURE: 
1.  Triple-lumen catheter placement, right IJ, using ultrasound 
and
fluoroscopy.  
2.  Celiac artery angiogram.  
3.  Coil embolization of the gastroduodenal artery.  
4.  SMA angiogram.  

FINDINGS:
1.Gastroduodenal artery with irregular branches supplying mass 
in the
duodenum. 
2.The SMA did not appear to supply the tumor or show active 
extravasation.  
3.Patent and compressible right internal jugular vein 
 
IMPRESSION:
1.Successful embolization of the gastroduodenal artery. 
2.Uncomplicated placement of a triple lumen catheter via the 
right internal
jugular vein. The tip terminates in the SVC and is ready for 
use. 
3.Small hematoma at the right femoral artery access site.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with pancreatic cancer s/p 
chemo/XRT who presented with hematemesis and was found to have a 
large mass on EGD and CTA. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
# GI Bleed, upper: Ms. ___ presented with hematemesis and EGD 
___ revealed a large fungating mass in the stomach and 
duodenum with an overlying clot. After lengthy discussion about 
contrast contraindication (nephrogenic systemic sclerosis 
history), a CTA abd/pelv ___ was obtained to assess for 
bleeding and suggested the the mass was secondary to erosive 
pancreatic cancer. A central line was placed by ___ on ___. She 
underwent ___ embolization of the gastroduodenal artery on ___ 
with subsequent nausea, but stable vitals post-procedure. Her 
medical management included pantoprazole gtt, NPO, transfusion 
of 3 units PRBCs on ___, and 2 units on ___. She received 5mg 
vitamin K on ___ for an INR of 1.4. Another 5mg of PO vitamin K 
was given on ___ for elevated INR. DIC work up was negative. Her 
diet was advanced to clears ___ and to a regular diet on ___ 
with no further hematemesis, melena, hematochezia. Her 
hematocrit trended down slowly on the floor and she underwent 
another 2 unit transfusion. She will likely continue to trend 
down slowly and may need subsequent transfusions in the future. 
She should undergo another hematocrit check on ___ during her 
next scheduled heme/onc appointment. 

# Pancreatic Cancer: She is followed by Dr. ___ ___. 
She is on gemcitabine with the last dose on ___. Radiation 
oncology determined that she is not a candidate for repeat XRT
